# Jeopardy

In this project, we will conduct a light analysis of a dataset that contains information about the popular game show Jeopardy. Our objective is to identify key aspects of the data that can assist individuals in preparing to participate in the game.

We will start by examining the dataset to see if it reveals any useful correlations or patterns. Based on our findings, we will provide recommendations on how to effectively use the dataset for studying for Jeopardy. The dataset we will be using, jeopardy.csv, includes the first 20,000 rows from a larger Jeopardy dataset.
