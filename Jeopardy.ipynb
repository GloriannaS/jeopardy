Because these values are all higher than 0.05, we cannot conclude that there is a meaningful link between the sample terms and whether questions are high-value or low-value. The chi-squared statistics also ranged from 0.04 to 2.81, showing that there is not much evidence of a significant connection between the terms and the question values.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we performed a focused analysis on a portion of data from the Jeopardy game show. Our aim was to identify useful insights for individuals studying or preparing to participate in Jeopardy. Based on our findings, we recommend further exploration in two key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The potential for questions to be repeated (which requires more data and time).\n",
    "2. The factors that determine a question's \"high-value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limited size of our dataset, we could not completely eliminate the possibility of question repetition, which remains a significant factor to consider for anyone studying the game. The small sample size may not adequately represent the full range of questions encountered in Jeopardy, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about patterns of repetition. Additionally, our analysis suggested that certain terms are unlikely to be strongly linked to high-value or low-value questions, indicating that other factors may play a more critical role in determining question value. This raises important questions about what truly defines a question's worth in the context of the game. Is it the complexity of the question, the subject matter, or perhaps the phrasing that influences its value? Further investigation in this area could provide valuable insights and better prepare participants to answer high-value questions in Jeopardy, ultimately enhancing their chances of success in the game. By exploring these dimensions, future research could contribute to a deeper understanding of the strategies that lead to high performance in Jeopardy."
